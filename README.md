A binary tree is a type of tree data structure in computer science where each node can have at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. It's defined recursively using set theory concepts as a tuple consisting of a left subtree, a root element, and a right subtree. This structure can also be depicted graphically, and from a graph theory perspective, binary trees are known as arborescences or bifurcating arborescences. Binary trees are rooted, ordered trees, and they are a special case of ordered K-ary trees where K is 2.

The precise definition of a binary tree can vary among authors. Some definitions require that every non-leaf node has exactly two children, while others allow non-leaf nodes to have fewer than two children. The arrangement of nodes within the tree can hold different significance depending on the context.

In computing, binary trees serve two main purposes. Firstly, they provide an efficient way to organize and access nodes based on their associated values. This application is utilized in binary search trees and binary heaps, which enable efficient searching and sorting operations. The distinction between left and right children is crucial in binary search trees. However, the specific arrangement of nodes within the tree does not impact the core conceptual information and can be rearranged without changing the fundamental meaning.

Secondly, binary trees are used to represent data with a bifurcating structure. In such cases, the arrangement of nodes holds meaningful information, and changing it would alter the data's interpretation. Examples include Huffman coding and cladograms. Analogously, everyday structures like document divisions into chapters, sections, and paragraphs can be thought of as n-ary trees, where n is not limited to 2.

In summary, a binary tree is a foundational data structure in computer science characterized by nodes with at most two children. It finds applications in efficient data access as well as representing data with a bifurcating structure, and its precise definition and significance can vary across different contexts and interpretations.
